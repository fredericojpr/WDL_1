World Data League Challenge #1

## Context
According to the World Bank, in 2016 cities generated 2.01 billion tons of solid waste. Per
person, this is around 0.74 kg/day! With the rapid growth of cities, this number is only
expected to increase. As cities are growing, it is urgent that optimization processes for
waste processing and more targeted public education on waste management and
separation. Finally, it is also important to note that waste collection also has an impact on
air pollution.
## Goal
The goal of this challenge is to help identify trends in waste production and help to create
insights into how to reduce waste and optimize its collection.

## Outcome
The expected outcome to this challenge is to identify waste trends and to produce an
explainable model for predicting future waste production.
Finally, donâ€™t forget to propose the application (product) for the model and study its
impact.
